                HYACINTH HALVEY_ by Lady Augusta Gregory
            </h4>
            
               <h6 Class="name"> MRS.DELANE.</h6> <p class="speech">There is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.</p>

<h6 Class="name"> MR.QUIRKE.</h6> <p class="speech">Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising?
    <p class="directions"> [It
makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the night-time.]</p>
Going about the country, looking for little stags of sheep, striving to
knock a few shillings together. That contract for the soldiers gives me
a great deal to attend to.</p>

<h6 Class="name">MRS.DELANE.</h6> <p class="speech">I suppose so. It's hard enough on myself to be down ready
for the mail-car in the morning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
often I haven't time to look who are the letters from--or the cards.</p>

<h6 Class="name">MR.QUIRKE.</h6> <p class="speech">It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
knocking about. <P class="directions">[If you did not have information of what is going on, who
should have it?]</p><p class="speech"> Was it you, ma'am, was telling me that the new
sub-sanitary inspector would be arriving to-day?</p>

<h6 Class="name">MRS.DELANE.</h6><p class="speech"> To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that
train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.</p>

<h6 Class="name">MR.QUIRKE.</h6><p class="speech"> A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.</p>

<h6 Class="name">MRS.DELANE.</h6> <p class="speech">So he is, one Hyacinth Halvey; and indeed if all that is
said of him is true, or if a quarter of it is true, he will be a credit
to this town.</p>
