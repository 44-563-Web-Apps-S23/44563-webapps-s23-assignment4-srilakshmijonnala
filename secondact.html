            <h6 Class="DELANE"> MRS.DELANE.</h6> <p class="speech">There is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.</p>

<h6 Class="QUIRKE"> MR.QUIRKE.</h6> <p class="speech">Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising?

for the mail-car in the modfgrning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
often I haven't time to look who are the letters from--or the cards.</p>
